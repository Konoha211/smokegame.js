# The Smoking Game

This is an interactive two-player game where a cigarette controller is passed between players at random intervals. The challenge is to be quick enough; if a player hesitates, they oversmoke and flatline. Both players must try to survive, but reaching the end results in both flatlining.

The game uses a physical cigarette-like device with sensors on its corners and a thumb button that forces players to hold it like a real cigarette. This game simulates the social pressure of smoking, highlighting how both participants ultimately face their demise through each otherâ€™s cooperation.
