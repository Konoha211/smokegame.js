# The Smoking Game

_Made for the course **DESIGN 6397 - Design for Physical Interaction I**._

## Overview

This project presents a wearable device that acts as a human-computer interface (HCI) for a 1-dimensional (1-D) game. The device resembles a cigarette, and the goal of the game is for the user to perform specific smoking-related motor-sensory actions (i.e. bringing the cigarette to the mouth or tapping on the base) in response to signals (i.e. red or green) in order to progress to the next level. The game alters these signals after the first level in order to mix the stimuli associated with smoking behavior, with the aim of confusing and reconditioning the user.
