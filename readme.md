# The Smoking Game

_This wearable device was created for the course **DESIGN 6397 - Design for Physical Interaction I**._

## Overview

This project presents a wearable device that acts as a human-computer interface (HCI) for a 1-dimensional (1-D) game. The device resembles a cigarette, and the goal of the game is for the user to perform specific smoking-related motor-sensory actions (i.e. bringing the cigarette to the mouth or tapping on the base) in response to signals (i.e. red or green) in order to progress to the next level. The game alters these signals after the first level in order to mix the stimuli associated with smoking behavior, with the aim of confusing and reconditioning the user.

By introducing these motor-sensory actions and linking them to a new set of stimuli, this game engages users in a way that disrupts the habitual movements connected to smoking. Through repetition, the user is encouraged to disassociate smoking-related actions from their usual reinforcing stimuli.

## Purpose

The game uses conditioning techniques in an attempt to promote self awareness of smoking behavior by interrupting the habitual sensory triggers. By confusing the usual triggers (i.e. switching the inputs and signals), it aims to bring attention to the automatic responses linked to smoking behavior.
